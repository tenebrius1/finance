# C$50 Finance

This project is part of a problem set from [CS50 2019](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2019/) course, specifically from [pset8](https://docs.cs50.net/2019/x/psets/8/finance/finance.html)
which introduced the concept of web programming, SQLite for data storage and API calls. It was meant to be a precursory project for learners to get their feets wet with web development with most of the design already laid out by the CS50 team. 

## Setup Guide
1. Clone or download the files as a zip.
2. `cd` into the finance folder that you just downloaded and run `$ python -m venv venv`. This will create a venv folder in your current directory.
3. Activate your virtual environment using `$ venv/Scripts/activate` for Windows users or `$ source <venv>/bin/activate` for UNIX users.
4. run `$ pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies.
5. `$ flask run` to start up your developement server on localhost.
