# C$50 Finance

This project is part of a problem set from [CS50 2019](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2019/) course, specifically from [pset8](https://docs.cs50.net/2019/x/psets/8/finance/finance.html)
which introduced the concept of web programming, SQLite for data storage and API calls. It was meant to be a precursory project for learners to get their feets wet with web development with
most of the design already laid out by the CS50 team.
